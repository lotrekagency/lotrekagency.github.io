# Documented before digital

The internal documentation for Lotrèk's developers. Here you can find anything you want to [start a new project](how-to/new-project.md), learn to use our [internal instruments](products/camomilla.md), consult the awesome [Lotrèk library](resources/books.md) or get a glance to our [methodology](methodology/index.md)

## Pay attention

You don't need to follow all the examples literally, most of them use functions names or database configuration that may differ from your current code (sometimes you may encounter [foo and bars](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/69788/what-is-the-history-of-the-use-of-foo-and-bar-in-source-code-examples/80609#80609))

## How to contribute

Create a virtualenv and install the dependencies

     pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want to add stuff or make some changes feel free to open a pull request to the [docs repository](https://gitlab.com/lotrekdevteam/docs/docs). Remember that this documentation is entirely written in [MarkDown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
